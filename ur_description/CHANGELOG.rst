^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.2.8 (2020-10-28)
------------------
* Fix test errors by adding config files to install
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/melodic-devel' into calibration_devel
* Merge pull request `#437 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/universal_robot/issues/437>`_ from ipa-nhg/safetylimits
  Add optional safety_controller tags to all joints in xacro macros
* migrated all package.xml files to format=2 (`#439 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/universal_robot/issues/439>`_)
* Merge pull request `#426 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/universal_robot/issues/426>`_ from fmauch/inertia
  corrected dimensions and positions of inertias
* Add optional safety_controller tags to all joints in xacro macros
* Merge pull request `#435 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/universal_robot/issues/435>`_ from fmauch/add_description_view_files
  Add description view files
* Add dependencies for view_x.launch files to the description packages
  As we use the joint_state_publisher, the robot_state_publisher and rviz
  inside the launch files, I added them as run-dependencies.
* Added view_x.launch files for all descriptions to easily check them.
  This resolves `#432 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/universal_robot/issues/432>`_
  To avoid introducing another dependency, I copied the rviz configuration
  from industrial_robot_client.
* corrected indentation of xacro files
* added ur3 and ur5 calibration
* added hash string to default paramset for ur10e and ur10
* changed ur10 description to use calibration parameters
* corrected dimensions and positions of inertias
  I'm by far not an expert in working with gazebo or inertias, but it seemed wrong to me:
  - The upper arm inertia of the ur10 is not centered in the visual arm segment
  - CoM in the wrist links don't sit inside the correct links. E.g. wrist1 has its CoM inside the end of the forearm for all robots.
  - Because of the second point the inertia's geometry of wrist3 is matching wrist2 instead of the actual moving part of wrist3.
  - Wrist dimensions of ur5 were completely off.
  - On the ur5e the arm inertias weren't centered in the visuals.
* 1.2.5

  * Fix overlapping properties between robot definitions
  Uploading a different UR definition used to break the previous definition files by overwriting their link lengths. This commit makes the property names for each robot unique so they are independent of the other robot models.
  * Move robot-specific parameters inside macro
  This is the cleaner solution for what the previous commit was meant to solve

* introducing urdf for ur3 - first draft

* description: add '_joint' suffix to newly introduced joint tags.
  This is more in-line with naming of existing joint tags.
* description: add ROS-I base and tool0 frames. Fix `#49 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/49>`_ and `#95 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/95>`_.
  Note that 'base' is essentially 'base_link' but rotated by 180
  degrees over the Z-axis. This is necessary as the visual and
  collision geometries appear to also have their origins rotated
  180 degrees wrt the real robot.
  'tool0' is similar to 'ee_link', but with its orientation such
  that it coincides with an all-zeros TCP setting on the UR
  controller. Users are expected to attach their own TCP frames
  to this frame, instead of updating it (see also [1]).

  Corrected UR10's urdf to faithfully represent joint effort thresholds, velocity limits, and dynamics parameters.
* Update ur5.urdf.xacro
  Corrected effort thresholds and friction values for UR5 urdf.
* added corrected mesh file
* Added definitions for adding tergets in install folder. Issue `#10 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/10>`_.
* Corrected warning on xacro-files in hydro.
* Added definitions for adding tergets in install folder. Issue `#10 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/issues/10>`_.

* prefix versions of gazebo and transmission macros
* Added joint limited urdf and associated moveit package.  The joint limited package is friendlier to the default KLD IK solution

* Updated urdf files use collision/visual models.
* Reorganized meshes to include both collision and visual messhes (like other ROS-I robots).  Modified urdf xacro to include new models.  Removed extra robot pedestal link from urdf (urdfs should only include the robot itself).
* minor changes on ur5 xacro files

* Renamed packages and new groovy version
* Added ur10 and renamed packages
